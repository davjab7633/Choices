  <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">I would love to do this because Hair stylists averaged earrings is $26,460 per year. Owning my own business would be a blessing , I would combine my nail skills with my hair skills into one salon. I'm going to be my own boss. </p>

  <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> international business degree and performance management. Starting at a bar or restaurant would start your position off because you will have good experience and a idea on how a business should be run.</p>
